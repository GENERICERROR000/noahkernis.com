      <description>GENERIC_ERROR is the name I create and produce some of my work under, and it has been ongoing since late 2016. It is an identity meant to be native to both digital and analog spaces. The primary way I distribute the illustrations is via Instagram (@generic_error) or Twitter (@GENERIC_ERROR).
GENERIC_ERROR intentionally plays with the overlap between the physical and the digital. I primarily illustrate on paper, and then scan with an app to fully process the work.</description>

INSULIN_PUMP is a large insulin pump where insulin is delivered when a person ‘pumps’ the device like water pump.
The person must first calculate how much insulin they need. Then, pump the lever for the desired amount. The number of of pumps is displayed.
Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) requires continuous work to manage the disease.</description>

Collaboration with Jake Sherwood.
MIDI_CAN is a networked, multi-mode, instrument/MIDI controller. It can be played by itself or collaboratively over the internet.
The device sends MIDI signals to your DAW of choice. A locally hosted Node server also broadcasts and listens for incoming MIDI commands over the internet, via UDP. Network configuration can be done on a website, hosted on the local server.</description>

Collaboration with Benjamin Moll.
PLEAD_FOR_YOUR_PILLS is critical of the American health care system and the power health insurance providers have over people.
With or without health insurance in the United States, people who need medicines or health services have to deal with arbitrary democracy in order to receive care.</description>

RELATIVE_CLOCK is a desk clock meant to be a reminder of someone we care about. The clock displays the current time, but when it is invert, the time changes.
The time is displayed on a small screen. The clock has buttons on the back to set the time. When the clock is is flipped upside-down, the display rotates 180 degrees and shows a different time.</description>

SELF_REINFORCEMENT explores the relationship between HUMANS, COMPUTERS, and how they “see” and interact with each other.
The piece allows for a HUMAN to work with a COMPUTER to create a HUMAN-like form using the video feed from multiple cameras observing the gallery crowd. The video feed is processed in real time by the BodyPix Tenserflow.</description>

Collaboration with Pippa Kelmenson.
ELASTIC_HEART looks at the relationship between humans, their organs, and what it means to transplant an organ.
The transplant process requires a donor, a recipient, and a third party to transport the organ. The person transporting the organ gains another organ for the duration of the trip.</description>
