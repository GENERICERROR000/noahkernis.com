*ELASTIC_HEART* looks at the relationship between humans, their organs, and what it means to transplant an organ.

The transplant process requires a donor, a recipient, and a third party to transport the organ. The person transporting the organ gains another organ for the duration of the trip.

When a person places their hand on the sides of the piece, they touch a pulse sensor. In response, the heart starts to “beat” at the person’s BPM. A screen also displays the pulse over time.

By holding the box, the person becomes the organ transport. The pulse reflects the persons, revealing it is now part of them.
