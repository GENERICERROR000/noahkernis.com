*Metal can, Arduino, copper, rotary encoder, Node.js, MIDI.*

Collaboration with [Jake Sherwood](https://jakesherwood.com/blog/tangibleinteractions/midi_can).


*MIDI_CAN* is a networked, multi-mode, instrument/MIDI controller. It can be played by itself or collaboratively over the internet.

The device sends MIDI signals to your DAW of choice. A locally hosted Node server also broadcasts and listens for incoming MIDI commands over the internet, via UDP. Network configuration can be done on a website, hosted on the local server.

Customizable modes and channel setup allow us to tailor to the device to our own preferences. Modes include: explore, channel select, chords, scales, sample glitching/volume adjustment, and broadcasting.

Four dedicated capacitive buttons can be combined with 4 capacitive slide inputs to create unique and interesting sounds.
