*RELATIVE CLOCK* is a desk clock meant to be a reminder of someone we care about. The clock displays the current time, but when it is invert, the time changes.

The time is displayed on a small screen. The clock has buttons on the back to set the time. When the clock is is flipped upside-down, the display rotates 180 degrees and shows a different time. The new time is +/- hours relative to the original time. For a moment, you get to be in time with your loved one.  

It is a small reminder of someone not currently present, throughout the day.
