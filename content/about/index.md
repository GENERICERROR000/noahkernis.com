I am an interdisciplinary artist and software engineer with a background in neuroscience, experience working in TV, Podcasting, and as a DevOps engineer. 

I am currently enrolled in the ITP program at NYU. You can see my work on my [blog](https://blog.noahkernis.com/).

<!-- 
After studying neuroscience at Skidmore College, I went from working in TV and Podcasting to being a DevOps Engineer. After wrestling with the ethics and impact of the companies I had done work with, I began to look for non-commercial modes of exploring technology as more than a corporate tool (and weapon). That led me to the ITP program at NYU.

My work has focused on surveillance capitalism (privacy, internet rights), the American healthcare system (primarily relating to Type 1 Diabetes, because I am one), and computer systems (networking, and projects involving distributed elements). My work takes the form of software based projects and/or physical computing and physical fabrication. -->
